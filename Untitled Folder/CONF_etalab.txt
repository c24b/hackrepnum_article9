    Focus on conversation method and on meme expressed in a short way (feeling/opinion)

Agenda participatif


Overlapping consensus with *practise* not ideology

With the pol.is system [http://docs.pol.is/] that has a special system of vote

"We wanted to preserve minority opinions. We don’t use downvoting to invalidate upvoting. We don't use upvoting to invalidate upvoting. If we did, like other comment systems do: 200 upvotes + 200 downvotes = net zero votes. That math obscures the fact that there was some minority who felt differently, which we take as data to preserve. As we iterated, this took the form of creating and showing opinion groups.
We wanted to create a system that increased the number of roles available. More roles means more data, and more interesting outcomes. Somewhere south of 1% of users comment. Most users lurk - read but don't interact in the community. Pol.is typically sees 10x more people vote than those who comment."

Letting them express their feelings and opinions:

I feel (weak)/ I think (strong) 10 seconds of attention


If representation of population * opinion < 80% not put in the agenda
